# 🤖 Build Real-World AI Agents — From Personal Productivity to Enterprise Automation

> A comprehensive, hands-on course for building intelligent AI agents that solve real problems across every domain of work and life.

---

## 🧭 Course Overview

This course takes you from zero to building production-ready AI agents step by step. You won't just learn theory — you'll ship agents that **actually work**, starting with tools you'll use yourself and scaling up to the kinds of systems organizations are actively deploying today.

By the end of this course, you'll have a portfolio of agents spanning personal productivity, creative work, research, and business operations — and the skills to build anything beyond it.
